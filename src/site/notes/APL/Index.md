	- The authors argue that since programs are mostly pretty complex systems, software developers had to come up with rules for how to deal with it. These are collectively known as refactoring - the iterative, small scale identification and reduction of complexity that keep a software system at a level where increases in complexity still lead to net-positive benefits. The paper asks: do these rules have real world analogies that we can use to reduce the complexity of socio-technical systems? I wouldn't say it's a particularly great paper, among other things because I always took issue even with some of the rules for software, but it has some interesting parts. This one reminded me especially of APL:
		- "The complexity analysis a designer should perform can be thought of as both being inside out and outside in. That is, the analysis should first proceed from the system in its most basic manifestation (e.g., a piece of software or hardware) and then consider the dependencies and interacting sociotechnical elements moving outward. Then the analysis should consider large-scale social system structures in which the system might play a role, and identify how those existing structures are affected by the new system. The approach undertaken here is likely similar in nature to life-cycle analysis, though with a broader aim."
