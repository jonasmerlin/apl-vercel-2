	- In this #paper the authors argue that since programs are mostly pretty complex systems, software developers had to come up with rules for how to deal with it. These are collectively known as refactoring - the iterative, small scale identification and reduction of complexity that keep a software system at a level where increases in complexity still lead to net-positive benefits. The paper asks: do these rules have real world analogies that we can use to reduce the complexity of socio-technical systems? I wouldn't say it's a particularly great paper, among other things because I always took issue even with some of the rules for software, but it has some interesting parts. This one reminded me especially of APL:
		- "The complexity analysis a designer should perform can be thought of as both being inside out and outside in. That is, the analysis should first proceed from the system in its most basic manifestation (e.g., a piece of software or hardware) and then consider the dependencies and interacting sociotechnical elements moving outward. Then the analysis should consider large-scale social system structures in which the system might play a role, and identify how those existing structures are affected by the new system. The approach undertaken here is likely similar in nature to life-cycle analysis, though with a broader aim."

		- "As I see it, technology has built the house in which we all live. The house is continually being extended and remodelled. More and more of human life takes place within its walls, so that today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house. All are affected by the design of the house, by the division of its space, by the location of its doors and walls. Compared to people in earlier times, we rarely have a chance to live outside this house. And the house is still changing; it is still being built as well as being demolished. In these lectures, I would like to take you through the house, starting with the foundation and then examining with you the walls that have been put up or taken down, the storeys and turrets that have been added, the flow of people through the house — who can come in, who can go into particular spaces.

	- "I think this link works for my book Architectural Intelligence: How Designers & Architects Created the Digital Landscape."
	- "The book is about much more than Alexander — and my research into the history of AI started with a footnote by Alexander in Notes on the Synthesis on Form (chapter 1, #19)"
	- "For me, I realized that Alexander & co viewed pattern languages as a network—not only a sequence. I saw it as an operating system for order, which was Alexander’s lifelong interest."
